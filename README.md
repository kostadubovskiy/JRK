# Tentative Idea
Tetris: 
  One and two-player game mode options using either wsda keys or up-down-left-right arrow 
  keys or both in processing.
  
  ## Relevance
    Data structures: 2 heaps to calculate median time-taken to place a block
                     1 heap to compare player scores in split screen mode
                     1 or 2 randomly filled array priority queues to determine the order in
                       which blocks come down onto the screen

  ## Housing
    It will be made with a combination of Processing for the GUI and Java classes for the backend
    It will be launched via terminal, by running the main.pde file.
