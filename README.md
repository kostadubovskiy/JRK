# Idea
Knockout Jr.:
    Based off of the Knockout game in game pigeon on iPhones, there is a playing area(iceberg)
  where each player starts with an equal amount of players(penguins). The goal is to direct
  your players into the opponents players to push them off of the iceberg. Basically, a bit like king
  of the hill with teams.

    One and two-player game mode options using mouse selection input

  ## Relevance
    Data structures: 2 pairs of min/max heaps to calculate median score of each player over a _ game series
                     1 heap to compare player scores in split screen mode
                     1 array priority queue to determine the order in which penguins are de-thawed (enabled for selection)
                     1 queue for the order of turns

  ## Housing
    It will be made with a combination of Processing for the GUI and Java classes for the back-end
    It will be launched via terminal, by running the main.pde file.
